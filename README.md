# Knockout Basics

A very simple app built to explore some of the basic concepts of Knockout JS.

* `data-bind` attribute
* `ko.applyBindings`
* `ko.observable`
* `ko.observableArray`
* handling `click` and `submit` events
* Knockout JS Validation Plugin

App's functionality is heavily based on tutorials by [Drew Conley](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvQwAK9oAYXM0RMucLy2-BA).
